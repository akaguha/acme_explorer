## Solo Iterative Process

SIP is a software process that single programmers use while working on a software project. The solo programmer who is the hero of this process is named “Sol”. Sol receives the requirements from the users and records them in the product backlog. From the iteration backlog, Sol selects a specific change request and implements the corresponding software changes. 

Product Backlog, Work log, Iteration log and Defect log for this project can be found [here][reference-id-for-here1].

The sprint planning notes can be viewed [here][reference-id-for-here2].
